                    There are millions of animals out there who are devoid of food and shelter. PetPay is an organization who takes care of animals in need and provides them with proper shelter, healthy food, medical care and most important the feeling of being ‘Loved’.
                    <br>
                    We are fortunate enough to help <b>10,000</b> animals (as of Sept-2021), through our organization and aim to multiply this number as much as <b>‘WE’</b> can do.
                    <br>
                    Come and join this noble cause.
                    The least we can do is extend our heart towards them.
